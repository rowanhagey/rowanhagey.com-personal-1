            <h4>Elevator Escape Video Game</h4>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>This was my final project for my first-ever coding class! The 
                        goal of the game is to amass as many points as possible. Each 
                        'tick' or turn, a new person spawns randomly on floors 0-9. As 
                        time goes on, those waiting at the elevator get progressively 
                        angrier, and your goal is to rack up the highest score you can 
                        with 3 elevators before 10 residents of the building 'explode' 
                        from anger. The catch is once an elevator is moving, it cannot 
                        be used between turns until it reaches its end target. A 
                        highlight of this project was my introduction to building an AI. 
                        The AI player was supposed to demonstrate a basic knowledge of 
                        the game, and after I finished building it, the AI tended to 
                        outplay most humans!

            <h4>Image Resizer</h4>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>This project calculated the energy of pixel paths within an image 
                        and cut out the path of least energy, effectively removing the 
                        least significant parts of an image. When adjusting an image, 
                        there would be minimal distortion from the original to the final.

            <h4>Euchre Game</h4>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>A surprisingly tricky yet fun project, this created an online 
                        way to play a card game popular in Michigan called Euchre! 
                        There was code for 4 players with choices for human or machine 
                        (AI) options.

            <h4>Text Editor</h4>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Most people use Google Docs and Microsoft Word on a daily basis 
                        now. This project aimed to create a basic text editor with insert, 
                        delete, up, down, and other functions needed to type a document. 
                        Behind this project was a network of doubly linked lists and 
                        dynamically allocated arrays.

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Piazza is the name of a popular forum to ask questions about 
                        coding at my school. This project takes in a dataset to train 
                        itself and then labels discussion posts by projects we've worked 
                        on by importing the words from a CSV file. Makes use of binary 
                        search trees and maps to propogate machine learning

                    true essence of a personal project and was incredibly fun and 
                    rewarding to build. This project is ever-updating as me and my

        <h3>Productivity App</h3>
            <div class="text">
                <p>As a student balancing schoolwork, career goals, coding projects, 
                    downtime, exercise, a social life, and more, I often find my life 
                    feeling hectic and disorganized. I never have enough time to do 
                    everything, or when I think I do I'm usually forgetting a crucial 
                    assignment or prior commitment. To remedy this I frequently time out 
                    my day, write to-do list, set reminders, and try to keep track of 
                    my life across a variety of platforms.
                </p>

                <p>This app is intended to be a free, all-in-one organizer. 
                    Whether it's homework, watering plants, or making plans with friends, 
                    this productivity app will help you manage everything from school to 
                    workouts to relaxation. Whatever you need, this app has you covered.

        <h3>AI Project</h3>
            <div class="text">
                <p>After I finish my productivity app, I am eager to further research 
                    field of artificial intelligence. I am determined to develop my 
                    skills and knowledge in AI, exploring its potential by working on my 
                    own innovative projects that can make a significant impact. Specifics 
                    to come!
