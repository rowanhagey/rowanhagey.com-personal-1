            <p>Outside of school, I enjoy staying active through working out and 
                spending time outdoors. I also love hanging out with friends, whether 
                it's exploring new places or just relaxing together. These activities 
                help me unwind, stay balanced, and show some of my personality.</p>

                <p>I love nature, I'm super supportive of conservation initiatives.

                <p>Hiking is one of my favorite forms of exercise. It serves as a great 
                    way to work out, see new things, and socialize.

                <p>This is a photo from Switzerland. This is one of the most beautiful 
                    places I have ever seen in my life. I can not believe people are 
                    lucky enough to live here. I love to travel and see new places 
                    and this has been a top 3 for me!

                <p>Growing up in Connecticut I have always lived near New York City. 
                    My cousins live there as well so I often have commuted in and slept 
                    there. I am set on living here for at least part of my life, the 
                    personality and always moving environment of New York is unrivaled.

            <div class="text">
                <p>This is a path I run on when I'm at college. Running has always 
                    been the way I best like to exercise, it helps clear my mind 
                    and focus me for the rest of the day.

            <div class="text">
                <p>While I tend to avoid water like a cat, I love to swim in a pool 
                    with friends over summer. No better way to relax and catch a tan.

                <p>I have a lot of allergies, but that doesn't stop me from constatly 
                    trying new foods and restaurants. Here's a photo of one of my 
                    favorites, a chicken parm from Mani Osteria in Ann Arbor.

                <p>While I am still an amatuer, I love to bake. Here is a cake I 
                    made in rough condition (it had 7 layers so give me some leeway). 
                    I promise my cookies are more aesthetic.

                <p>I love movies and TV. Everything Everywhere All At Once is my 
                    favorite. I think film has both a great fun to it but also the 
                    ability to impact those watching deeply. I screenwrtie in my 
                    freetime and have taken some classes.

                <p>Here's a photo of a Taylor Swift concert my whole family went to.
