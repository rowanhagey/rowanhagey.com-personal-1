                Hello! I'm Rowan Thomas Hagey, originally from Darien, Connecticut. 
                Growing up on the East Coast has shaped my love for the outdoors 
                and my drive to make a positive impact in the world.

                I'm currently a junior at the University of Michigan, where I'm 
                majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I chose 
                Michigan for its renowned programs, rigorous academics, and the 
                vibrant campus life, including the football culture. Go Blue!

                As a Computer Science major with a minor in Mathematics, I spend a 
                lot of time on school-driven CS projects and am now branching out 
                into my own developments. My education is preparing me for a future 
                where I can merge technical skills with creative problem-solving.

                My goal is to become a software engineer focused on creating 
                applications that improve daily life. I have a strong interest in 
                front-end development, aiming to build software that is both functional 
                and aesthetically pleasing.

                I believe my purpose in life is to make those around me as happy as 
                possible and to improve the world, even if it's just by helping a few 
                people. This belief drives my ambition to create impactful and 
                user-friendly software.

                Outside of my academic and career pursuits, I am an active member of 
                the Theta Xi fraternity. I love working out, hanging out with friends, 
                and spending time outdoors. When I'm not busy with school, you can find 
                me pursuing my passions, which you can explore further on my
